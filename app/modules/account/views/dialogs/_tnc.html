        <h4>ECOGIV SERVICE GUARANTEE</h4>
        <p>To protect against the risk of liability, payment for purchases made to Seller using the Services will be held by ECOGIV in an account separate from our corporate funds (“ECOGIV Escrow Account”) and ECOGIV will not use your funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes. Seller will not receive interest or other earnings from the sum you have paid into the said Account.</p>
        <p>After Buyer makes payment for his/her order Buyer’s, the payment will be held in ECOGIV Escrow Account until:</p>
        <p>(a) Buyer sends confirmation to ECOGIV that Buyer has received his/her goods, in which case, ECOGIV will release Buyer’s Purchase Monies in ECOGIV Escrow Account to Seller;</p>
        <p>(b) ECOGIV determines that Buyer’s application for a return of goods and/or refund is successful, in which case, unless, ECOGIV will provide a refund to Buyer, subject to and in accordance with the Refunds and Returns Policy;</p>
        <p>ECOGIV Service Guarantee is only offered to Buyers who have made payment through the channels provided by ECOGIV into ECOGIV Escrow Account. Offline arrangements between Buyer and Seller will not be covered under ECOGIv Service Guarantee.</p>
        <p>Payments made through ECOGIV channels will be held in the ECOGIV Escrow Account for a specified period of time (the “ECOGIV Guarantee Period”). [LINK]. Buyer may apply for a one-time extension of ECOGIV Guarantee Period prior to the expiry of the applicable ECOGIV Guarantee Period, subject to and in accordance with the Refunds and Returns Policy. Upon Buyer’s application, ECOGIV Guarantee Period may be extended for a maximum period of three (3) days unless ECOGIV in its sole discretion determines that a longer extension is appropriate or required.</p>
        <p>Seller must be the beneficial owner of the Account and conduct business only on behalf of him or herself. ECOGIV may require copies of Seller’s personal data such as recent identity photograph, bank account details and/or any other such documentation necessary, for verification purposes. Seller hereby authorises ECOGIV to use Seller’s personal data to make any inquires we consider necessary to validate Seller’s identity with the appropriate entity such as Seller’s bank. For more information in relation to how ECOGIV handles your personal information, please read [LINK]</p>
        <p>The ECOGIV Service Guarantee is in addition and without limitation to Buyer’s and Seller’s obligations under applicable law, which may go above and beyond what is provided for by the it. The ECOGIV Service Guarantee is neither intended nor designed to assist Buyer or Seller in complying with its own legal obligations, for which each party will remain solely responsible, and ECOGIV accepts no liability in connection with the same.</p>
        <p>Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that ECOGIV’s decision (including any appeals) in respect of and relating to any issues concerning the ECOGIV Service Guarantee is final.</p>
        <p><strong>DELIVERY AND SHIPPING</strong></p>
        <p>ECOGIV will inform Seller when ECOGIV receives Buyer’s Purchase Payment. Seller should then make the necessary arrangements to have the purchased item delivered to Buyer and provide details such as the name of the delivery company, the tracking number, etc. to Buyer through the Site. Seller must use his/her best effort to ensure that Buyer receives the purchased items within, whichever applicable, ECOGIV Guarantee Period or the time period specified (for offline payment) by Seller on Seller’s listing.</p>

        <p><strong>PURCHASE AND PAYMENT</strong></p>
        <p>ECOGIV supports the following payment methods:</p>
        <p>(i) Credit Card</p>
        <p>Card payments are processed through third-party payment channels and the type of credit cards accepted by these payment channels may vary depending on the jurisdiction you are in.</p>

        <p>(ii) Bank Transfer</p>
        <p>Buyer may make payments through an Automated Teller Machine or internet bank transfer (“Bank Transfer”) to our designated ECOGIV Account. Buyer must provide EOGIV with the transfer receipt or payment transaction reference for verification purposes through the ‘Upload Receipt’ function in ECOGIV’s app as payment confirmation. If payment confirmation is not received by ECOGIV within three (3) business days, Buyer’s order will be cancelled.</p>

        <p>(iii) Offline Arrangement</p>
        <p>Buyer has the option of placing orders offline directly with Seller (“Offline Arrangement”). However, such Offline Arrangement will not qualify for the protection offered by ECOGIV.</p>
        <p>Buyer may only change their preferred mode of payment for their purchase prior to making payment. ECOGIV takes no responsibility and assume no liability for any loss or damages to Buyer arising from shipping information and/or payment information entered by Buyer or wrong remittance by Buyer in connection with the payment for the items purchased. We reserve the right to check whether Buyer is duly authorised to use certain payment method, and may suspend the transaction until such authorisation is confirmed or cancel the relevant transaction where such confirmation is not available.</p>

        <p><strong>CANCELLATION, RETURN AND REFUND</strong></p>
        <p>Buyer may only cancel his/her order prior to the payment of Buyer’s Purchase Payment into ECOGIV Escrow Account.</p>
        <p>Buyer may apply for the return of the purchased item and refund prior to the expiry of ECOGIV Guarantee Period, if applicable, subject to and in accordance with ECOGIV’s Refunds and Return Policy. Please refer to [Refunds and Returns Policy]</p>
